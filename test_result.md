# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Iteration 10 UI fixes:
  1. Members screen: Add explicit Active / Expired filter chips (staff can also view/filter members by status)
  2. Bill detail badge: fix hardcoded "MEMBER · 10% off". Must reflect the actual per-member discount %
     (e.g. show "MEMBER · 20% off" when a member has a 20% override, or the salon default otherwise)
  3. Shared bill PDF: show the salon/branch logo on the invoice
  4. Branches management: allow uploading a logo per branch
  5. Salon Settings: split into Company (tenant-level) + Branch (per-branch with dropdown selector).
     Branch dropdown must switch the form context and let admin save per-branch: logo, address,
     phone, email, tax, invoice prefix, receipt header/footer
  6. Users management: admin can assign a specific branch to each user/staff during create/edit

    message: |
      Iteration 10 UI-focused changes are in. All fixes are frontend-only; the backend
      already exposed the fields (branch.logo, branch tax/address/prefix/receipt fields,
      UserCreate/UserUpdate.branch_id, bill.member_discount_pct_applied).
      Please verify:
        1) Members screen shows 4 chips (All/Active/Expiring/Expired) and filters correctly.
           Staff role (staff@glowup.com/staff123) should also see and use these filters.
        2) Create a bill for a member with a 20% override — the bill detail badge should read
           "MEMBER · 20% off" (not 10%). Share → PDF should also show 20%.
        3) The shared PDF must render the logo. Configure a branch logo via Manage → Branches
           edit and verify it appears. If branch logo empty, tenant logo should show.
        4) Manage → Branches modal has a logo picker; saving persists via PUT /branches/{id}.
        5) Salon Settings screen: Company section saves via PUT /tenants/me. Branch section
           has a dropdown to pick a branch; changing branch loads fresh values; Save Branch
           calls PUT /branches/{id} and updates fields (logo, address, tax, prefix, footer).
        6) Users screen: creating/editing a user now shows a branch chooser. Staff role must
           require a branch; admin can be 'All Branches'. Persisted via /auth/register &
           /auth/users/{id}.
      Test credentials: /app/memory/test_credentials.md — Glow Up owner (admin@glowup.com/admin123)
      and staff (staff@glowup.com/staff123).
